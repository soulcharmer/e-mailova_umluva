About
The Email Charter was created in response to widespread acknowledgement that email is getting out of hand for many people. It started life as a blog post by TED Curator Chris Anderson and TED Scribe Jane Wulf. The idea struck a chord. More than 45,000 people read the post and and it generated hundreds of tweets, comments and suggestions. That is how the final Charter was shaped. Some of the key contributors are listed here.

The Charter is a private, non-commercial initiative, a simple 'idea worth spreading'.

If you have comments or suggestions, please join the conversation here.

Please consider sharing the Charter with others by tweeting, blogging, or adding it to your email signature.

Thank you!
